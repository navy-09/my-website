The Inland Marina project is an ASP.NET MVC web application that was developed as part of the curriculum at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. It utilizes an Entity Framework Code First approach to establish a database; HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are used for creating visually pleasing and highly functional views; the background logic for the controllers and defining the data models for this project is done using C#. The primary objective of this project is to create essential user functionalites including: account registration, secure login, browsing and booking dock slips, and editing and viewing bookings. The application's interface is made up of a comprehensive landing page, a contact page, dedicated registration and login pages, and a dynamic display for avaibale dock slips, all designed to use the created dataset.
