This project focuses on the initial development of a web application for Inland Marina Ltd, a prominent boat marina situated on the popular Inland Lake. The primary objective of this assignment is to build a foundation for their online leasing services by creating a user-friendly interface that allows the public to access essential information about the marina and view the availability of boat slips.

The application addresses Inland Marina's need to automate their slip leasing inquiries due to increasing tourism, which has made their current telephone-based booking system inefficient. By providing an online platform, the marina aims to streamline information access for potential customers and free up office staff to focus on other critical tasks.

Key Features Implemented in this Assignment:

Informational Home Page: 

A welcoming landing page providing an overview of Inland Marina, including its location, history since its establishment in 1967, its status as the largest marina on Inland Lake, the range of its 90 slips (16-32 feet), and the dock services offered (electrical and fresh water). The corporate logo is integrated to establish branding. A clear call to action, "Contact Us," directs users to the contact information.

Comprehensive Contact Page: 

A dedicated page displaying all essential contact details for Inland Marina, including their full address (Box 123, Inland Lake, Arizona 86038), office and leasing phone numbers (928-555-2234, 928-555-2235), fax number (928-555-2236), and the names and roles of key personnel (Manager: Glenn Cooke, Slip Manager: Kimberley Carson), along with a contact email address (info@inlandmarina.com). A link is provided for easy navigation back to the Home page.

Dynamic Available Slips Listing: 

A "Slips" page that dynamically displays a list of all currently available (unleased) boat slips. This feature retrieves real-time data from the database to show users which slips are currently open for lease. Furthermore, users are provided with the functionality to filter this list of available slips by selecting a specific dock, allowing them to narrow down their search based on location within the marina.

Technical Implementation:

This web application is being developed using the ASP.NET Core MVC framework in conjunction with the Entity Framework Code-First approach. The InlandMarina database, designed according to the provided ERD, is managed using SQL Server (likely accessed through SSMS). The entity classes (Dock, Customer, Slip, Lease) and the database context are organized within a separate class library project to promote code organization and maintainability. The user interface is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS to achieve a professional and corporate look and feel, incorporating the supplied corporate logo and relevant imagery. Navigation between the Home and Slips pages is facilitated through a standard navigation bar.
