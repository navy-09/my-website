This Windows desktop application serves as the Travel Experts employee portal, providing secure login for employees and agents using their email and the last four digits of their business phone number. Upon successful authentication via a SQL database, users access a comprehensive suite of features built with C# and Entity Framework Core. These functionalities support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing various aspects of the business, including associating products with specific suppliers, creating, modifying, and potentially deleting travel packages, and managing travel product information. This allows for efficient and complete data management within the employee portal.
