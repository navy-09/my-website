This Windows desktop application, built with C# in Visual Studio, enables users to manage tasks through a user-friendly interface displaying task names, statuses, and creation dates. It supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks stored in a database, allowing users to add new tasks and view/expand existing ones. The application uses SQL queries within the C# code to interact with the database.
