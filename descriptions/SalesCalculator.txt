This Windows desktop application, developed using C# in Visual Studio, streamlines the calculation of daily sales targets. Users can input store hours, individual shift timings, and a total sales target. The application then calculates the "floor time" for each shift (accounting for breaks and time outside store operating hours) and distributes the total target proportionally based on these hours. It allows users to add multiple shifts, calculate individual sales targets, save daily targets with associated shift details, and print this information.
